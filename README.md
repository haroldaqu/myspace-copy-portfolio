## Overview 
1. **Purpose:**
    - Creating a fun and nostalgic portfolio 

2. **New skills learned:**
    - Mobile responsiveness
       - using min and max for height and width to set limit on element sizes
       - exclusively using realtive values (rem, em, %, etc..) allowing elements to shrink/grow based on screen size
       - using media queries only for complexities such as changing element orientation based on screen size    
    - Hamburger Menu
       - adding icons to elements (adding the hamburger icon to a button)
    - Modals with dialog
       - using dialog and its built in functions to create/display modals
